# Reply to PR Comment 2361238865: GitHub Actions Cron Settings and JST Time

## Thank you for the valuable feedback!

Thank you for raising these important points about the GitHub Actions cron settings and their relation to JST time. You're absolutely correct about several technical inaccuracies in our documentation. I've addressed these issues:

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Day-of-Week Range Correction
**Issue**: The documentation incorrectly stated day-of-week range as (0-7)
**Fix**: Updated to the correct range (0-6 or SUN-SAT) with clarification that 0/SUN = Sunday

```diff
- | 5th | `*` | Day of week (0-7) - Any day of the week |
+ | 5th | `*` | Day of week (0-6 or SUN-SAT) - Any day of the week (0/SUN = Sunday) |
```

### 2. UTC to JST Day-of-Week Examples
**Issue**: The examples for weekdays and Monday scheduling didn't account for the day-of-week shift between UTC and JST
**Fix**: Corrected the cron examples to properly target JST days when executed at 22:00 UTC

```diff
- # Weekdays only at 7 AM JST
- - cron: "0 22 * * 1-5"
+ # Weekdays only at 7 AM JST (adjusted: runs at 22:00 UTC on Sun-Thu, which is 07:00 JST Mon-Fri)
+ - cron: "0 22 * * 0-4"

- # Every Monday at 7 AM JST
- - cron: "0 22 * * 1"
+ # Every Monday at 7 AM JST (adjusted: runs at 22:00 UTC on Sun, which is 07:00 JST Mon)
+ - cron: "0 22 * * 0"
```

### 3. Calendar Day Clarity
**Issue**: Potential confusion about which calendar day the UTC time refers to
**Fix**: Updated README.md to consistently use "UTC 前日" (UTC previous day) for clarity

```diff
- 日本時間毎朝 7:00（UTC 22:00）
+ 日本時間毎朝 7:00（UTC 前日 22:00）
```

## Time Zone Considerations Explained

### Why This Matters
When scheduling GitHub Actions with cron for JST timing:

1. **Time Conversion**: JST is UTC+9, so 07:00 JST = 22:00 UTC (previous day)
2. **Day-of-Week Shift**: Since UTC time is 9 hours earlier, the day-of-week in UTC is different from JST
3. **Business Logic**: For workflows targeting Japanese business hours, we need to account for this shift

### Practical Examples
- **Target**: Monday 07:00 JST
- **UTC Equivalent**: Sunday 22:00 UTC
- **Cron Expression**: `"0 22 * * 0"` (0 = Sunday in UTC)

- **Target**: Weekdays (Mon-Fri) 07:00 JST
- **UTC Equivalent**: Sun-Thu 22:00 UTC
- **Cron Expression**: `"0 22 * * 0-4"` (Sun-Thu in UTC)

## Current Implementation
Our workflows currently use:
```yaml
schedule:
  - cron: "0 22 * * *"  # Daily at 07:00 JST (22:00 UTC previous day)
```

This correctly targets 07:00 JST every day, which aligns with our goal of running automation before Japanese business hours.
